Overview

I made a portfolio for a make believe company that makes candles. Its a legacy company honouring my late siter who passed away in 2022 from a car accident. its not her in the picture I just found the pictures i used to be very relvant to what i wanted to convey in the layout.

Reflections

I am enjoying the project and putting together the portfolio. i am having issues with the pictures and making them fit in the screen but i have been reading up and trying to fix the issue.

Areas of Mastery

I can say I am comfortable with html and all the functions and how its structure is.

Challenges Faced

Putting the pictures and making them to be all same size and display in a portrait and landscape position.

Areas for Improvement

The css. I still need more practice
