## **Responsive design Project**
This is a very exciting project for me, its a lot of code to get through and i have not fully gotten thorough understanding of the css but i am now faily comfortable with html and a few concepts of css. 
### Overview
i made a portfolio for a make believe company that makes candles. its a legacy company honouring my late siter who passed away in 2022 from a car accident. its not her in the picture i just found the pictures i used to be very relvant to what i wanted to convey in the layout. 
### Reflections
I am enjoying the project and putting together the portfolio. i am having issues with the pictures and making them fit in the screen but i have been reading up and trying to fix the issue.
#### Areas of Mastery
i can say i am comfortable with html and all the functions and how its structure is.
#### Challenges Faced
Putting the pictures and making them to be all same size and display in a portrait and landscape position.
#### Areas for Improvement
the css. I still need more practice
